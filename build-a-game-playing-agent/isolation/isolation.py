This file contains the `Board` class, which implements the rules for the
game Isolation as described in lecture, modified so that the players move
like knights in chess rather than queens.

You MAY use and modify this class, however ALL function signatures must
remain compatible with the defaults provided, and none of your changes will
be available to project reviewers.
