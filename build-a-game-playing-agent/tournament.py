"""
Estimate the strength rating of student-agent with iterative deepening and
a custom heuristic evaluation function against fixed-depth minimax and
alpha-beta search agents by running a round-robin tournament for the student
agent. Note that all agents are constructed from the student CustomPlayer
implementation, so any errors present in that class will affect the outcome
here.

The student agent plays a fixed number of "fair" matches against each test
agent. The matches are fair because the board is initialized randomly for both
players, and the players play each match twice -- switching the player order
between games. This helps to correct for imbalances in the game due to both
starting position and initiative.

For example, if the random moves chosen for initialization are (5, 2) and
(1, 3), then the first match will place agentA at (5, 2) as player 1 and
agentB at (1, 3) as player 2 then play to conclusion; the agents swap
initiative in the second match with agentB at (5, 2) as player 1 and agentA at
(1, 3) as player 2.

DESCRIPTION = """
This script evaluates the performance of the CustomEval heuristic function
by calibrating against the strength rating of agents using other heuristic
functions of known strength.  The `ID_Improved` agent provides a baseline
by measuring the performance of a basic agent using Iterative Deepening
and the "improved" heuristic (from lecture) on your hardware.  The
`Student` agent then measures the performance of Iterative Deepening and
the CustomEval heuristic against the same opponents.
