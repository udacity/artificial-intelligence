"""
This file contains all the classes you must complete for this project.

You can use the test cases in agent_test.py to help during development, and
augment the test suite with your own test cases to further test your code.

You must test your agent's strength against a set of agents with known
relative strength using run_tournament.py and include the results in your
report.

        Parameters
        ----------
        game : `isolation.Board`
            An instance of `isolation.Board` encoding the current state of the
            game (e.g., player locations and blocked cells).

class CustomPlayer:

    Game-playing agent that chooses a move using your evaluation function and a

    Parameters
    ----------
    search_depth : int (optional)
        A strictly positive integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3,...) for the number of
        layers in the game tree to explore for fixed-depth search. This is
        defined such that a depth of one (1) would only explore the immediate
        sucessors of the current state.

    heuristic : class (optional)
        The name of a class to use for heuristic evaluation of game states.

    iterative : boolean (optional)
        Flag indicating whether to perform fixed-depth search (False) or
        iterative deepening search (True).

    method : {'minimax', 'alphabeta'} (optional)

        NOTE: If time_left < 0 when this function returns, the agent will

        Parameters
        ----------
        game : `isolation.Board`

            game (e.g., player locations and blocked cells).

        legal_moves : list<(int, int)>
            A list containing legal moves. Moves are encoded as tuples of pairs
            of ints defining the next (row, col) for the agent to occupy.

        time_left : callable
            A function that returns the number of milliseconds left in the
            current turn. Returning with any less than 0 ms remaining forfeits
            the game.

        Returns
        ----------
        (int, int)
            Board coordinates corresponding to a legal move; may return
            (-1, -1) if there are no available legal moves.
